##Sort Algorithms
### Bubble sort
#### In-Place algorithm
_"Transforms input using no auxiliary data structure. It updates input sequence only through replacement or swapping"
. In-place means that the algorithm doesn't use extra space for manipulating the input but may requires a small though non-costant extra space for its operations._

Big-O Notation
- O(n²) **Quadratic**
- 10 items will take 100 steps, **n** items will take **n²**
- Non constant extra space O(n) sometime O(logn)
