It's an [abstract data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) <br>
Works as FIFO _First in, First Out_ <br>

* Push : adds an item as the top item on the stack
* Pop: removes the top item on the stack
* Peek: gets the top item on the stack without popping it.

Time Complexity

* O(1) in push, pop, peek
* O(n) in arrays because the array may have to be resized
